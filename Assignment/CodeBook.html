<h2>Data Collection</h2>

<p>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. </p>

<p>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.. </p>

<h2>Source of Data</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip">Data Set</a> </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones">Description of Data Set</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Transformation</h2>

<p>Following data transformations are carried out by the <code>run_Analysis.R</code> script.</p>

<ol>
<li>The data sets were read seperately. First read was done on Subject Dataset for both train and test files. The 2nd read was on Y dataset for both test and train which gave the activity id associated with the test and train value.</li>
<li>Features were read in the next step. This gave us the variable column names.</li>
<li>The X Data Set (train and test) containing the measures was read and column names obtained from step 2 were assigned to the measures.</li>
<li>Activity Labels were read next and stored in internal table.</li>
<li>The data sets obtained in step2 were than subset to get columns having only &ldquo;mean&rdquo; and &ldquo;std&rdquo; terms in them. I only chose the above columns as the excercise asked us to pick columns for mean and standard deviation and in my opinion this is how it should be.</li>
<li>The data sets for train and test obatined from the above steps were than merged to create a single data set for each internal table. One data set each for X, Y, Labels and Subject.
7.Created a table with the Activity and Subject ID assigned to X dataset and assigned Activity Labels to final dataset.</li>
<li>Appropriately labelelled the data set with descriptive activity names by removing special characters like &ldquo;.&rdquo; and also removing the double occurence of &ldquo;Body&rdquo; in column headers using gsub() function.</li>
<li>Melted the dataset using reshape2 package by specifying activityId, activityName and subject Id as the only ID variables and rest all as measure variables.</li>
<li>Re casted the melted dataset with activityName and subjectId as the  ID variables and <code>mean</code> as the aggregator function.</li>
<li>Saved the output in a new file called &ldquo;new_tidy_data.txt&rdquo; using write.table() function.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Data Variable Explanation</h2>

<p>The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix &#39;t&#39; to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. </p>

<p>Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). </p>

<p>Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the &#39;f&#39; to indicate frequency domain signals). </p>

<p>These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:<br/>
&#39;-XYZ&#39; is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.</p>

<p>The set of variables that were estimated from these signals (and used in this assignment) are:</p>

<ul>
<li>mean(): Mean value</li>
<li>std(): Standard deviation</li>
</ul>
